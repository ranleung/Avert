- 1 - 4 pictures of the app


## Gameplay

Use your hero to avert the enemies at all costs!

(Good Square Asset) is the good square.

(Bad Square Asset) is the bad square.

All the squares on the screen increase speed and size as you acquire more squares.

Be sure to get the good power ups and avoid the bad power ups!


## Development
Avert is written in Swift on Xcode 6.1.  We decided to use Sprite Kit as our game engine for graphics rendering and animation infrastructure.  AVFoundation and AudioToolbox was used to integrate customized music during game play, acquring squares, and squares explosion.  Game Center is also integrated within the app by using Game Kit framework for the high score leaderboard.
