# Avert

Get The Squares!

Avert is an arcade game, the goal of which is to absorb as many blue squares as possible without crashing into an orange square.  Try to collect the blue power-ups, but watch out for Mr.Red, who will surely play shenanigans with your hero!

All the squares on the screen increase speed and size as you acquire more squares.

Be sure to get the good power ups and avoid the bad power ups!


## Development
Avert is written in Swift on Xcode 6.1.  We decided to use Sprite Kit as our game engine for graphics rendering and animation infrastructure.  AVFoundation and AudioToolbox was used to integrate customized music during game play, acquring squares, and squares explosion.  Game Center is also integrated within the app by using Game Kit framework for the high score leaderboard.
